# Instructions  

Write a program that asks the user to enter an item's wholesale cost and its markup percentage. It should then display the item's retail price. For example:

* If an item's wholesale cost is $5.00 and its markup percentage is 100 percent, then the item's retail price is $10.00.

* If an item's wholesale cost is $5.00 and its markup percentage is 50 percent, then the item's retail price is $7.50.

The program should have a function named `calculateRetail` that receives the wholesale cost and the markup percentage as arguments and returns the retail price of the item.
